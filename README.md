# Pinyon-Detection

A research pipeline for detecting and classifying pinyon, juniper, and
ponderosa pine trees from drone-collected SfM point clouds. Developed
for the **Sunset Crater** field site (`Sunset_sfm_trial`) and designed to run
on the **Monsoon** SLURM HPC cluster.

The pipeline ingests raw `.las` files, builds a Canopy Height Model, detects
tree tops as CHM peaks, segments individual crowns via watershed, matches
GPS-tagged ground-truth species to clusters, and trains a species classifier
on the labeled subset.

It's split into two independent stages:

- **`clustering/`** — everything expensive: point cloud processing, CHM,
  watershed segmentation, GPS label matching. Run via `run_clustering.py`,
  usually swept over many parameter combinations to optimize the matching
  score. See [`clustering/README.md`](clustering/README.md).
- **`modelling/`** — species classification on the labeled clusters
  `clustering/` produced. Run via `train_model.py`, fast enough to iterate
  on interactively. See [`modelling/README.md`](modelling/README.md).

These used to be one script (`main.py`). They were split apart because sweep
jobs only ever needed the clustering half, and running a full classifier
comparison on every sweep array task was cluttering logs for no benefit —
the labeled set doesn't change between clustering-parameter sweep
iterations.

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment setup

```bash
bash shells/setup_venv.sh
source open3d_env/bin/activate
```

Requires Python 3.10. Key dependencies: `open3d`, `numpy`, `scipy`,
`scikit-learn`, `rasterio`, `scikit-image`, `laspy`, `pyproj`, `pandas`,
`matplotlib`. For `modelling/`'s `--advanced` flag, also install `xgboost`
and `lightgbm` (not in `setup_venv.sh` yet).

`.gitignore` excludes `open3d_env/` and every generated pipeline artifact
(point clouds, clusters, CHMs, dataframes, images, SLURM logs) — these are
all regenerable from a `run_clustering.py` run and get large fast, so they
stay out of git history. `results/` CSVs are small and are the actual
experiment record, so those stay tracked.

### 2. Configure paths and steps

Edit `clustering/constants.py`:
- `get_paths(trial_name)` — all input/output paths, derived from the trial name
- `STEPS` — boolean flags controlling which clustering stages re-run

### 3. Run clustering + labeling

```bash
sbatch clustering/shells/pinyons.sh
```

See [`clustering/README.md`](clustering/README.md) for CLI args, the
`params.txt` sweep format, and current known quirks (a couple of
CLI params don't do what their names suggest yet — worth reading before
you burn a sweep on the wrong one).

### 4. Train the classifier

```bash
sbatch shells/train_model.sh
```

See [`modelling/README.md`](modelling/README.md) for the enhancement
toggles, the `--advanced` classifier comparison, and semi-supervised label
spreading.

## Matching Score

`clustering/`'s output metric: the fraction of GPS-labeled trees with
exactly one detected cluster within `max_distance`.

```
Perfect matches (1:1):  58  (82.9%)
No match:                8  (11.4%)
Multiple clusters:        4   (5.7%)
Matching score:         0.829
```

Best achieved on Sunset Crater so far: **~0.83**.

## The Data Bottleneck

The labeled dataset is small — **~166 labeled clusters**, with **ponderosa
at only ~20 samples**. This has been the fundamental constraint on
classifier performance; no model architecture, oversampling, weighting, or
feature engineering approach tried so far has overcome it. More labeled
ground-truth data, not a better classifier, is the highest-leverage next
step for the modelling side.

---

## Field Site

**Sunset Crater**, Arizona. The scan area covers a cinder cone with
significant terrain variation (~30 m relief). The irregular drone flight
path means coverage is not a uniform rectangle — a `coverage_radius`
proximity filter in the label matcher handles the non-rectangular footprint.

Species present: pinyon pine, juniper, ponderosa pine.
